<p>Naruto Uzumaki (Japanese: うずまき ナルト, Hepburn: Uzumaki Naruto)<br/> (/ˈnɑːrutoʊ/) is the titular protagonist of the manga/ Anime Naruto, created<br /> by Masashi Kishimoto. He is a ninja from the fictional Hidden Leaf Village<br /> (Japanese: 木ノ葉隠れ, Hepburn: konohagakure). As a boy, Naruto is ridiculed<br /> and ostracized on account of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox a malevolent<br /> creature that attacked Konohagakure that was sealed away in his body.<br /> Despite this, he aspires to become his village's leader, the Hokage, in order to<br /> receive their approval. His carefree, optimistic, and boisterous personality enables<br /> him to befriend other Konohagakure ninja, as well as ninja from other villages. <br />Naruto appears in the series' films and in other media related<br /> to the franchise, including video games and original <br />video animations (OVA), as well as the sequel <br />Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, where he is the Hokage, <br />and his son, Boruto Uzumaki, <br />is the protagonist.</p> <br />
    <p>When creating Naruto for the initial part of the series, Kishimoto kept the<br /> character "simple and stupid", while giving him many attributes of an ideal hero.<br /> Kishimoto gave Naruto a dark side by adding tragedy to the character's past.<br /> He has revised Naruto's image many times, providing the character with simple<br /> clothes to fit the young demography. Kishimoto changed his <br />design for Part II of the storyline, which starts <br />two-and-a-half years after Part I. Naruto is voiced by Junko <br />Takeuchi in the original animated series and Maile Flanagan in the English adaptations.</p>
