          <p align="left"><font color="white">Sasuke Uchiha (Japanese: うちは サスケ, Hepburn: Uchiha Sasuke) (/ˈsɑːskeɪ/) <br />is a fictional character in the Naruto manga and anime franchise created by <br/>Masashi Kishimoto. Sasuke belongs to the Uchiha clan, a notorious ninja family, and<br /> one of the most powerful, allied with Konohagakure (木ノ葉隠れの里, English version:<br /> "Hidden Leaf Village"). Most of its members were massacred by Sasuke's older <br />brother, Itachi Uchiha, before the series began, leaving Sasuke one of<br /> the few living. Despite becoming empathetic toward his teammates Naruto<br /> Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno, Sasuke's feelings of powerlessness force him <br />to abandon his friends and his home in his quest to become stronger, and to find <br />Orochimaru. Sasuke appears in several of the series' animated feature films and related media,<br /> including video games, original video animations (OVAs), and Boruto: Naruto the Movie (2015) <br />and its manga sequel, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (2016), in which he is depicted as a<br /> vigilante supporting his village and a mentor to Naruto's son Boruto Uzumaki.</p></font>
